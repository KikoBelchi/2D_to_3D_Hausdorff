""" Reorder vertex data of TowelWall2 dataset.
Since it is created with Blender, it comes with an ordering of vertices which is not very useful.
This function permutes rows in the data files so that all the vertex info is ordered so 
that the first vertex is the top-left one in the mesh, and it moves rightwards and the downwards."""
